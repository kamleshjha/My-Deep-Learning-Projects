# My-Deep-Learning-Projects



A Data Science Enthusiast and an IT Professional and a long time self-taught Learner. I have completed many MOOC's on Big Data University and Udemy but this one was just the best which was given by Andrew Ng.He is a master in Deep Learning Tutoring and the support from DeepLearning.ai team was very quick when needed.

This Repository contains 3 folders namely
1.Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2.Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3.Structuring Machine Learning Projects
